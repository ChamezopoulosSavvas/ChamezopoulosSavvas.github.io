# Dev Portfolio

This is the actual code developed for the website you are currently looking at. 
It is a simple webpage, hosted on github pages. The main goal of this project is 
to wrap and present my main projects uploaded on github along with my CV and some basic contact info. 
At the same time, I had the chance to learn a few things on HTML, CSS and javascript.
